# History
Lipor is the reincarnation of https://sourceforge.net/p/rjpokerreplay/code/, so 98% of Lipor is written by Ralf Joswig. Thank you very much for your work!
Support for win2day was implemented by one guy for his friends. After finishing development his friends found out that PokerTracker can already handle win2day. So this app is probably not in use anymore.
